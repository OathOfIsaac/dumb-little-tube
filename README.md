# Description
This is part of an internship with a media company. I was tasked with implementing a custom animation in the background of a demo ecommerce site. I was given two files to work with: A custom cursor file and a tube animation. I will be uploading these files to jsdeliver and hrefing them through the clients desired platform, WebFlow. Finalized website will be edited into ReadME later.
# Installation
Instructions will be added when I figure it out myself.
## Usage
Stick animation in a div and use the mouse to make the animation rotate.
## Credits
Animation not coded by me, Cannot find credit.
